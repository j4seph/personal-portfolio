					A website that I co-founded with a colleague that serves both
					customers and insurance brokers. The customer visits the website,
					fills in their details requesting a quote and is contacted by a number
					of insurance brokers that are able to assist.
				</p>
				<p class="gray">This website is now closed.</p>

			<h1>About the project</h1>
			<div class="about-text-container">
				<section>
					<p>
						During my years working at an insurance brokerage, I’ve worked
						alongside a number of different companies that provide “leads” to
						us. The role of their company is simply to gather information from
						customers and provide it to a number of insurance brokers, taking a
						fee for every lead that’s provided.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having looked at the poor quality (no offence) of some of their
						websites and having a knowledge of customer acquisition/marketing, I
						decided that I would take a shot at creating a website of my own, in
						an attempt to create a source of what you could call passive income.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Together with a colleague of mine, who holds a degree in accounting,
						we combined our skill sets and set out to build a functioning
						website/company. Myself handling the design, user research and the
						marketing, my colleague handling the legalities and accounting, a
						match made in heaven.
					</p>
					<p>
						I originally designed the website back in 2017, however it has had a
						few design overhauls throughout the years in order to keep
						conversions high, testing pages and tweaking were necessary.

			<h1>Wireframing</h1>
			<div class="wireframe-text-container">
				<p class="description">
					As you can see, when I was wireframing this project, I wanted the form
					to take centre stage. After all, this is a lead generation website,
					the main goal is for the customer to fill in the form. However, that
					being said, I couldn’t immediately show the form to the customer
					without first using the hero section to inform them about the product
					we endorse. This shows the customer our value as a company, but can
					also act as a filter, providing information to people who might be
					confused. This filter provides further value to our insurance brokers
					as it can turn away time-wasters and allow us to provide more reliable
					leads.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I was already thinking about the type of form I would serve to the
					customer. I needed to get enough information from the customer so that
					the insurance broker would have more of an idea regarding their needs.
					But, I also needed the form to be short enough to not scare people
					away from filling it in. I decided to test both a long-form style and
					a modular design, intended to break up the information for the
					customer, making the form seem shorter and more satisfying to
					complete.

		<div class="mockups fade">
			<h1>High fidelity mockups</h1>
			<p class="description">
				It’s important to test a range of different design styles in order to
				see what customers are actually more inclined to interact with.
				Reviewing a design's performance and taking action based on data is much
				more effective than going with what you “know” works. For this reason,
				when I wireframe and create mockups, I like to give a few variations of
				the same object to test with. Below are a few of the different forms and
				hero sections that I decided to test with courierinsurance.org.

			<h1>In summary</h1>
			<p class="description">
				The website has been profitable since it’s launch and actively brings in
				customers each month. Current figures are sitting around 4.5k total
				website visitors and 1.5k leads generated, which is a conversion rate of
				a very respectable 30% or so. Hopefully, I will continue to see growth
				in these numbers and evolve the website in the right direction to keep
				the customers coming.
