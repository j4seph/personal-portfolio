				<h1>Reps Towards Reopening</h1>

					A website that shows countdowns to different dates on the UK’s roadmap
					to removing lockdown restrictions and how they relate to where, when

			<h1>About the project</h1>
			<div class="about-text-container">
				<section>
					<p>
						I live in an apartment with a long-time friend of mine, who just so
						happens to be a full-stack developer. Together, we decided that we
						would collaborate on a project together. At the time, we were still
						abiding by UK lockdown restrictions, however there had recently been
						published by the government, information regarding the steps towards
						easing these restrictions, along with key dates. We were both
						interested in this information, particularly how it related to
						returning to the gym, as we were both eager to go back.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whilst we discussed this, we came up with the idea to create a
						website with a countdown until the glorious day we could walk
						through those gym doors and lift some weights (before the urge to
						eat pizza and sink into the sofa returned). On top of this, we could
						share this link with other like-minded people, such as avid
						gym-goers and personal trainers. Thus, Reps Towards Reopening was
						born.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						The main hurdle we had to overcome with this project was the fact
						that if we wanted it to be at all relevant and worth checking out,
						we would have to deliver it in a short time frame. For this reason,
						we would have to cut the fat from the design to deliver a streamline
						and simple, but informative experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea of having to create and make the website function at pace
						was both exciting and motivating. It was good to have a partner in
						collaboration with me, so that we could bounce ideas off of each
						other.

			<h1>Wireframing</h1>
			<div class="wireframe-text-container">
				<p class="description">
					Since the government had been gracious enough to tell us the date each
					lockdown restriction would be lifted, it was very easy for me to take
					this information and convert it into website sections. Each date would
					have it’s own countdown and label informing the user what they could
					do on that date. For example, one of the sections was “Workout with 6
					people, outside or in a garden, mini boot camp time!”
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					I liked the idea of the countdown being detailed enough to show
					seconds, minutes and hours counting down in real-time. This would give
					the user a greater feeling of the day approaching and prove more
					satisfying as a result. I decided that it would be good to implement
					this on the closest forthcoming date as to draw more attention to it.

				I wanted the design and the colours to convey energy and excitement.
				Energy being the feeling and motivator that is exuded when working out.
				Excitement, the feeling that I had both about the gym reopening but also
				working on the project. For this reason I opted for using colours that
				popped out of the page to bring the excitement. I also used
				images/vectors of humans, which after being stuck inside for a year,
				some of us furloughed, I thought would be a great motivator as we all
				wanted to have the human contact and interaction we once took for
				granted.

			<h1>In summary</h1>
			<p class="description">
				It was a lot of fun to sprint through this design and build it out in
				such a short time period. I didn’t have time to get carried away being a
				perfectionist, however, the design that I created was of a high quality
				and looked very professional. It was also great collaborating with my
				housemate, who I learned a lot from, especially code and prototyping
				wise. After sharing the design with a number of people, we had a lot of
				positive feedback and even a couple of donations, which just helped
				cover the cost of hosting the website.
