			<h1>About the project</h1>
			<div class="about-text-container">
				<section>
					<p>
						J and S Foods is a fresh food wholesaler that has been trading in
						Leeds since 1977. They offer bespoke packages to businesses and
						deliver all of the produce themselves. Their website was last
						developed back in 2014, when apparently it was cool to have a red
						leather background.
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot has changed in the years since 2014, including the produce
						they provide and the customers they’re trying to reach. For this
						reason, they asked for my help in creating a website that is more
						in-line with modern design standards and adjusted to their needs at
						present.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						A big change they have encountered is their customers' high demand
						for vegan products. Their old website had no mention of anything
						vegan related, so they wanted the new design to push those products
						and raise awareness to potential customers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Together with my housemate, who is a developer himself, we built a
						new responsive website for J and S. I created the design and digital
						assets in Figma/Adobe Photoshop/Adobe Illustrator and he coded the
						website using ReactJS.

			<h1>Wireframing</h1>
			<div class="wireframe-text-container">
				<p class="description">
					Before I wire-framed this project, I spoke to the guys in charge at
					J&S Foods to discover what they wanted to achieve with the website.
					Their main purpose for updating the website was to allow customers to
					read their different product lists online. Usually they would hand
					these out in person, however this could be tedious as they would
					always have to reprint them when the lists needed editing.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					On top of that, the customer would already have to be in the store to
					have access to a product list. This informed my decisions when
					wireframing, dedicating my time tailoring the website's focus towards
					these product lists and how the customer could enquire further about
					them.

			<h1>High fidelity mockups</h1>
			<p class="description">
				From the conversations I had with the owners, I decided to incorporate
				plant-based colours and embellishments to the design. This would convey
				to the customer the idea of freshness and also compliment their vegan
				products. Additionally, I thought it would be a good idea to break down
				the product lists into different, personalised business categories and
				list these categories on a products page. This way the customer can find
				the product list relating to their business, saving them a lot of time
				compared to reading a full products list and having to pick out items
				relating to their business one by one.

			<h1>In summary</h1>
			<p class="description">
				J and S were very happy with the new design and felt it accomplished the
				goals that they set out to solve when hiring me to update their website.
				They loved how I incorporated the various leaves and fresh vegetables to
				the design, further promoting the vegan products they have a high demand
				for. The website now gives the customer the opportunity to browse their
				products online with ease and contact them further if they need to
				discuss something. I had a lot of fun building out the various pages of
				this website and it was a great learning experience. I think it has had
				a great impact on my skills and has taken my web designs to the next
				level.
